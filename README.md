OCRmyPDF adds an OCR text layer to scanned PDF files, allowing them to be searched or copy-pasted.

```bash
ocrmypdf                      # it's a scriptable command line program
   -l eng+fra                 # it supports multiple languages
   --rotate-pages             # it can fix pages that are misrotated
   --deskew                   # it can deskew crooked PDFs!
   --title "My PDF"           # it can change output metadata
   --jobs 4                   # it uses multiple cores by default
   --output-type pdfa         # it produces PDF/A by default
   input_scanned.pdf          # takes PDF input (or images)
   output_searchable.pdf      # produces validated PDF output
```

Main features
-------------

-   Generates a searchable [PDF/A](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=PDF/A) file from a regular PDF
-   Places OCR text accurately below the image to ease copy / paste
-   Keeps the exact resolution of the original embedded images
-   When possible, inserts OCR information as a "lossless" operation without disrupting any other content
-   Optimizes PDF images, often producing files smaller than the input file
-   If requested deskews and/or cleans the image before performing OCR
-   Validates input and output files
-   Distributes work across all available CPU cores
-   Uses [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) engine
-   Supports more than [100 languages](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata) recognized by Tesseract
-   Battle-tested on thousands of PDFs, a test suite and continuous integration

For details: please consult the [documentation](https://ocrmypdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Motivation
----------

I searched the web for a free command line tool to OCR PDF files on Linux/UNIX: I found many, but none of them were really satisfying.

-   Either they produced PDF files with misplaced text under the image (making copy/paste impossible)
-   Or they did not handle accents and multilingual characters
-   Or they changed the resolution of the embedded images
-   Or they generated ridiculously large PDF files
-   Or they crashed when trying to OCR
-   Or they did not produce valid PDF files
-   On top of that none of them produced PDF/A files (format dedicated for long time storage)

...so I decided to develop my own tool.

Installation
------------

Linux, UNIX, and macOS are supported. Windows is not directly supported but there is a Docker image available that runs on Windows.

Users of Debian 9 or later or Ubuntu 16.10 or later may simply

```bash
apt-get install ocrmypdf
```

and users of Fedora 29 or later may simply

```bash
dnf install ocrmypdf
```

and macOS users with Homebrew may simply

```bash
brew install ocrmypdf
```

For everyone else, [see our documentation](https://ocrmypdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) for installation steps.

Languages
---------

OCRmyPDF uses Tesseract for OCR, and relies on its language packs. For Linux users, you can often find packages that provide language packs:

```bash
# Display a list of all Tesseract language packs
apt-cache search tesseract-ocr

# Debian/Ubuntu users
apt-get install tesseract-ocr-chi-sim  # Example: Install Chinese Simplified language back
```

You can then pass the `-l LANG` argument to OCRmyPDF to give a hint as to what languages it should search for. Multiple languages can be requested.

Documentation and support
-------------------------

Once ocrmypdf is installed, the built-in help which explains the command syntax and options can be accessed via:

```bash
ocrmypdf --help
```

Our [documentation is served on Read the Docs](https://ocrmypdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

If you detect an issue, please:

-   Check whether your issue is already known
-   If no problem report exists on github, please create one here: <https://github.com/jbarlow83/OCRmyPDF/issues>
-   Describe your problem thoroughly
-   Append the console output of the script when running the debug mode (`-v 1` option)
-   If possible provide your input PDF file as well as the content of the temporary folder (using a file sharing service like Dropbox)

Requirements
------------

Runs on CPython 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7. Requires external program installations of Ghostscript, Tesseract OCR, QPDF, and Leptonica. ocrmypdf is pure Python, but uses CFFI to portably generate library bindings.
