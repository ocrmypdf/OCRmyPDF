|latest|

The easiest way to install OCRmyPDF is to follow the steps for your operating
system/platform, although sometimes this version may be out of date.

If you want to use the latest version of OCRmyPDF, your best bet is to install
the most recent version your platform provides, and then upgrade that version by
installing the Python binary wheels.

Users of Debian 9 ("stretch") or later or Ubuntu 18.04 or later may
simply

.. code-block:: bash

    apt-get install ocrmypdf

As indicated in the table above, Debian and Ubuntu releases may lag
behind the latest version. If the version available for your platform is
out of date, you could opt to install the latest version from source.
See `Installing HEAD revision from
sources <#installing-head-revision-from-sources>`__. Ubuntu 16.10 to 17.10
inclusive also had ocrmypdf, but these versions are end of life.

For full details on version availability for your platform, check the
`Debian Package Tracker <https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/ocrmypdf>`__ or
`Ubuntu launchpad.net <https://launchpad.net/ocrmypdf>`__.

.. note::

   OCRmyPDF for Debian and Ubuntu currently omit the JBIG2 encoder.
   OCRmyPDF works fine without it but will produce larger output files.
   If you build jbig2enc from source, ocrmypdf 7.0.0 and later will
   automatically detect it (specifically the ``jbig2`` binary) on the
   ``PATH``. To add JBIG2 encoding, see :ref:`jbig2`.

Fedora 29 or newer

    dnf install ocrmypdf

For full details on version availability, check the `Fedora Package
Tracker <https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/ocrmypdf>`__.

If the version available for your platform is out of date, you could opt
to install the latest version from source. See `Installing HEAD revision
from sources <#installing-head-revision-from-sources>`__.

.. note::

   OCRmyPDF for Fedora currently omits the JBIG2 encoder due to patent
   issues. OCRmyPDF works fine without it but will produce larger output
   files. If you build jbig2enc from source, ocrmypdf 7.0.0 and later
   will automatically detect it on the ``PATH``. To add JBIG2 encoding,
   see `Installing the JBIG2 encoder <jbig2>`__.

.. _ubuntu-lts-latest:

Installing the latest version on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
-------------------------------------------------

Ubuntu 18.04 includes ocrmypdf 6.1.2. To install a more recent version,
first install the system version to get most of the dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install \
        ocrmypdf \
        python3-pip

There are a few system dependency changes since ocrmypdf 6.1.2. Let's
get these, too.

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install \
        libxml2 \
        pngquant

Then install the most recent ocrmypdf for the local user and set the
user's ``PATH`` to check for the user's Python packages.

.. code-block:: bash

    export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH
    pip3 install --user ocrmypdf

To add JBIG2 encoding, see :ref:`jbig2`.

Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
----------------

No package is available for Ubuntu 16.04. OCRmyPDF 8.0 and newer require
Python 3.6. Ubuntu 16.04 ships Python 3.5, but you can install Python
3.6 on it. Or, you can skip Python 3.6 and install OCRmyPDF 7.x or older
- for that procedure, please see the installation documentation for the
version of OCRmyPDF you plan to use.

**Install system packages for OCRmyPDF**

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common python-software-properties
    sudo add-apt-repository -y \
        ppa:jonathonf/python-3.6 \
        ppa:alex-p/tesseract-ocr
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y \
        ghostscript \
        libexempi3 \
        libffi6 \
        pngquant \
        python3.6 \
        qpdf \
        tesseract-ocr \
        unpaper

This will install a Python 3.6 binary at ``/usr/bin/python3.6``
alongside the system's Python 3.5. Do not remove the system Python. This
will also install Tesseract 4.0 from a PPA, since the version available
in Ubuntu 16.04 is too old for OCRmyPDF.

Now install pip for Python 3.6. This will install the Python 3.6 version
of ``pip`` at ``/usr/local/bin/pip``.

.. code-block:: bash

    curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | sudo python3.6

**Install OCRmyPDF**

OCRmyPDF requires the locale to be set for UTF-8. **On some minimal
Ubuntu installations systems**, it may be necessary to set the locale.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Optional: Only need to set these if they are not already set
    export LC_ALL=C.UTF-8
    export LANG=C.UTF-8

Now install OCRmyPDF for the current user, and ensure that the ``PATH``
environment variable contains ``$HOME/.local/bin``.

.. code-block:: bash

    export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH
    pip3 install --user ocrmypdf

To add JBIG2 encoding, see :ref:`jbig2`.

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
----------------

Installing on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) is more difficult than some
other options, because of its age. Several backports are required. For
explanations of some steps of this procedure, see the similar steps for
Ubuntu 16.04.

Install system dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install \
        software-properties-common python-software-properties \
        zlib1g-dev \
        libexempi3 \
        libjpeg-dev \
        libffi-dev \
        pngquant \
        qpdf

We will need backports of Ghostscript 9.16, libav-11 (for unpaper 6.1),
Tesseract 4.00 (alpha), and Python 3.6. This will replace Ghostscript
and Tesseract 3.x on your system. Python 3.6 will be installed alongside
the system Python 3.4.

If you prefer to not modify your system in this matter, consider using a
Docker container.

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:vshn/ghostscript -y
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:heyarje/libav-11 -y
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:alex-p/tesseract-ocr -y
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jonathonf/python-3.6 -y

    sudo apt-get update

    sudo apt-get install \
        python3.6-dev \
        ghostscript \
        tesseract-ocr \
        tesseract-ocr-eng \
        libavformat56 libavcodec56 libavutil54 \
        wget

Now we need to install ``pip`` and let it install ocrmypdf:

.. code-block:: bash

    curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py -o - | python3.6 && python3.6 -m easy_install pip
    pip3.6 install ocrmypdf

The optional dependency ``unpaper`` is only available at 0.4.2 in Ubuntu 14.04,
and no backports are available. Previously the author maintained a backported
.deb package for unpaper 6.1, but since Ubuntu 14.04 is now end of life, this is
not supported. As such, ``unpaper`` is not available on Ubuntu 14.04 or must by
compiled by hand.

To add JBIG2 encoding, see :ref:`jbig2`.

ArchLinux (AUR)
---------------

.. image:: https://repology.org/badge/version-for-repo/aur/ocrmypdf.svg
    :alt: ArchLinux
    :target: https://repology.org/metapackage/ocrmypdf

There is an `ArchLinux User Repository package for
ocrmypdf <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ocrmypdf/>`__. You can use
the following command.

.. code-block:: bash

    yaourt -S ocrmypdf

If you have any difficulties with installation, check the repository
package page.

Other Linux packages
--------------------

See the
`Repology <https://repology.org/metapackage/ocrmypdf/versions>`__ page.

In general, first install the OCRmyPDF package for your system, then
optionally use the procedure `Installing with Python
pip <#installing-with-python-pip>`__ to install a more recent version.

Installing on macOS
===================

Homebrew
--------

.. image:: https://img.shields.io/homebrew/v/ocrmypdf.svg
    :alt: homebrew
    :target: http://brewformulas.org/Ocrmypdf

OCRmyPDF is now a standard `Homebrew <https://brew.sh>`__ formula. To
install on macOS:

.. code-block:: bash

    brew install ocrmypdf

This will include only the English language pack. If you need other
languages you can optionally install them all:

.. code-block:: bash

    brew install tesseract-lang  # Optional: Install all language packs

.. note::

   Users who previously installed OCRmyPDF on macOS using
   ``pip install ocrmypdf`` should remove the pip version
   (``pip3 uninstall ocrmypdf``) before switching to the Homebrew
   version.

.. note::

   Users who previously installed OCRmyPDF from the private tap should
   switch to the mainline version (``brew untap jbarlow83/ocrmypdf``)
   and install from there.

Manual installation on macOS
----------------------------

These instructions probably work on all macOS supported by Homebrew.

If it's not already present, `install Homebrew <http://brew.sh/>`__.

Update Homebrew:

.. code-block:: bash

    brew update

Install or upgrade the required Homebrew packages, if any are missing.
To do this, download the ``Brewfile`` that lists all of the dependencies
to the current directory, and run ``brew bundle`` to process them
(installing or upgrading as needed). ``Brewfile`` is a plain text file.

.. code-block:: bash

    wget https://github.com/jbarlow83/OCRmyPDF/raw/master/.travis/Brewfile
    brew bundle

This will include the English, French, German and Spanish language
packs. If you need other languages you can optionally install them all:

.. _macos-all-languages:

   .. code-block:: bash

    brew install tesseract --with-all-languages  # Option 2: for all language packs

Update the homebrew pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip3 install --upgrade pip

You can then install OCRmyPDF from PyPI, for the current user:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip3 install --user ocrmypdf

or system-wide:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip3 install ocrmypdf

The command line program should now be available:

.. code-block:: bash

    ocrmypdf --help

Installing on FreeBSD
=====================

.. image:: https://repology.org/badge/version-for-repo/freebsd/python:ocrmypdf.svg
    :alt: FreeBSD
    :target: https://repology.org/project/python:ocrmypdf/versions

FreeBSD 11.2, 11.3, 12.0-RELEASE and 13.0-CURRENT are supported. Other
versions likely work but have not been tested.

.. code-block:: bash

    pkg install py36-ocrmypdf

To install a more recent version, you could attempt to first install the system
version with ``pkg``, then use ``pip install --user ocrmypdf``.

Installing the Docker image
===========================

For some users, installing the Docker image will be easier than
installing all of OCRmyPDF's dependencies. For Windows, it is the only
option.

See `OCRmyPDF Docker Image <docker>`__ for more information.

Installing on Windows
=====================

Direct installation on Windows is not currently possible, but it works well in
Windows Subsystem for Linux:

#. Install Ubuntu 18.04 for Windows Subsystem for Linux, if not already installed.
#. Follow the procedure to install :ref:`OCRmyPDF on Ubuntu 18.04 <ubuntu-lts-latest>`.
#. Open the Windows command prompt and create a symlink:

.. code-block:: powershell

    wsl sudo ln -s  /home/user/.local/bin/ocrmypdf /usr/local/bin/ocrmypdf

Then confirm that the expected version from PyPI (|latest|) is installed:

.. code-block:: powershell

    wsl ocrmypdf --version

You can then run OCRmyPDF in the Windows command prompt or Powershell, prefixing
``wsl``, and call it from Windows programs or batch files.

Why no native Windows?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It would probably not be too difficult to port on Windows. The main
reason this has been avoided is the difficulty of packaging and
installing the various non-Python dependencies: Tesseract, QPDF,
Ghostscript, Leptonica. Pull requests to add or improve Windows support
would be quite welcome.

Docker
^^^^^^

You can also :ref:`Install the Docker <docker-install>` container on Windows. Ensure that
your command prompt can run the docker "hello world" container.

Installing with Python pip
==========================

OCRmyPDF is delivered by PyPI because it is a convenient way to install
the latest version. However, PyPI and ``pip`` cannot address the fact
that ``ocrmypdf`` depends on certain non-Python system libraries and
programs being instsalled.

For best results, first install `your platform's
version <https://repology.org/metapackage/ocrmypdf/versions>`__ of
``ocrmypdf``, using the instructions elsewhere in this document. Then
you can use ``pip`` to get the latest version if your platform version
is out of date. Chances are that this will satisfy most dependencies.

Use ``ocrmypdf --version`` to confirm what version was installed.

Then you can install the latest OCRmyPDF from the Python wheels. First
try:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip3 install --user ocrmypdf

You should then be able to run ``ocrmypdf --version`` and see that the
latest version was located.

Since ``pip3 install --user`` does not work correctly on some platforms,
notably Ubuntu 16.04 and older, and the Homebrew version of Python,
instead use this for a system wide installation:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip3 install ocrmypdf

Requirements for pip and HEAD install
-------------------------------------

OCRmyPDF currently requires these external programs and libraries to be
installed, and must be satisfied using the operating system package
manager. ``pip`` cannot provide them.

-  Python 3.6 or newer
-  Ghostscript 9.15 or newer
-  qpdf 8.1.0 or newer
-  Tesseract 4.0.0-beta or newer

As of ocrmypdf 7.2.1, the following versions are recommended:

-  Python 3.7 or 3.8
-  Ghostscript 9.23 or newer
-  qpdf 8.2.1
-  Tesseract 4.0.0 or newer
-  jbig2enc 0.29 or newer
-  pngquant 2.5 or newer
-  unpaper 6.1

jbig2enc, pngquant, and unpaper are optional. If missing certain
features are disabled. OCRmyPDF will discover them as soon as they are
available.

**jbig2enc**, if present, will be used to optimize the encoding of
monochrome images. This can significantly reduce the file size of the
output file. It is not required.
`jbig2enc <https://github.com/agl/jbig2enc>`__ is not generally
available for Ubuntu or Debian due to lingering concerns about patent
issues, but can easily be built from source. To add JBIG2 encoding, see
:ref:`jbig2`.

**pngquant**, if present, is optionally used to optimize the encoding of
PNG-style images in PDFs (actually, any that are that losslessly
encoded) by lossily quantizing to a smaller color palette. It is only
activated then the ``--optimize`` argument is ``2`` or ``3``.

**unpaper**, if present, enables the ``--clean`` and ``--clean-final``
command line options.

These are in addition to the Python packaging dependencies, meaning that
unfortunately, the ``pip install`` command cannot satisfy all of them.

Installing HEAD revision from sources
=====================================

If you have ``git`` and Python 3.6 or newer installed, you can install
from source. When the ``pip`` installer runs, it will alert you if
dependencies are missing.

If you prefer to build every from source, you will need to `build
pikepdf from
source <https://pikepdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#building-from-source>`__.
First ensure you can build and install pikepdf.

To install the HEAD revision from sources in the current Python 3
environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip3 install git+https://github.com/jbarlow83/OCRmyPDF.git

Or, to install in `development
mode <https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/setuptools.html#development-mode>`__,
allowing customization of OCRmyPDF, use the ``-e`` flag:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip3 install -e git+https://github.com/jbarlow83/OCRmyPDF.git

You may find it easiest to install in a virtual environment, rather than
system-wide:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone -b master https://github.com/jbarlow83/OCRmyPDF.git
    python3 -m venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    cd OCRmyPDF
    pip3 install .

However, ``ocrmypdf`` will only be accessible on the system PATH when
you activate the virtual environment.

To run the program:

.. code-block:: bash

    ocrmypdf --help

If not yet installed, the script will notify you about dependencies that
need to be installed. The script requires specific versions of the
dependencies. Older version than the ones mentioned in the release notes
are likely not to be compatible to OCRmyPDF.

For development
---------------

To install all of the development and test requirements:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone -b master https://github.com/jbarlow83/OCRmyPDF.git
    python3 -m venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    cd OCRmyPDF
    pip install -e .
    pip install -r requirements/dev.txt -r requirements/test.txt

To add JBIG2 encoding, see :ref:`jbig2`.

Shell completions
=================

Completions for ``bash`` and ``fish`` are available in the project's
``misc/completion`` folder. The ``bash`` completions are likely ``zsh``
compatible but this has not been confirmed. Package maintainers, please
install these at the appropriate locations for your system.

To manually install the ``bash`` completion, copy
``misc/completion/ocrmypdf.bash`` to ``/etc/bash_completion.d/ocrmypdf``
(rename the file).

To manually install the ``fish`` completion, copy
``misc/completion/ocrmypdf.fish`` to
``~/.config/fish/completions/ocrmypdf.fish``.
