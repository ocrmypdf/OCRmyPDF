Control of unpaper
==================

OCRmyPDF uses ``unpaper`` to provide the implementation of the
``--clean`` and ``--clean-final`` arguments.
`unpaper <https://github.com/Flameeyes/unpaper/blob/master/doc/basic-concepts.md>`__
provides a variety of image processing filters to improve images.

By default, OCRmyPDF uses only ``unpaper`` arguments that were found to
be safe to use on almost all files without having to inspect every page
of the file afterwards. This is particularly true when only ``--clean``
is used, since that instructs OCRmyPDF to only clean the image before
OCR and not the final image.

However, if you wish to use the more aggressive options in ``unpaper``,
you may use ``--unpaper-args '...'`` to override the OCRmyPDF's defaults
and forward other arguments to unpaper. This option will forward
arguments to ``unpaper`` without any knowledge of what that program
considers to be valid arguments. The string of arguments must be quoted
as shown in the examples below. No filename arguments may be included.
OCRmyPDF will assume it can append input and output filename of
intermediate images to the ``--unpaper-args`` string.

In this example, we tell ``unpaper`` to expect two pages of text on a
sheet (image), such as occurs when two facing pages of a book are
scanned. ``unpaper`` uses this information to deskew each independently
and clean up the margins of both.

.. code-block:: bash

    ocrmypdf --clean --clean-final --unpaper-args '--layout double' input.pdf output.pdf
    ocrmypdf --clean --clean-final --unpaper-args '--layout double --no-noisefilter' input.pdf output.pdf

.. warning::

   Some ``unpaper`` features will reposition text within the image.
   ``--clean-final`` is recommended to avoid this issue.

.. warning::

   Some ``unpaper`` features cause multiple input or output files to be
   consumed or produced. OCRmyPDF requires ``unpaper`` to consume one
   file and produce one file. An deviation from that condition will
   result in errors.

.. note::

   ``unpaper`` uses uncompressed PBM/PGM/PPM files for its intermediate
   files. For large images or documents, it can take a lot of temporary
   disk space.

Control of OCR options
======================

OCRmyPDF provides many features to control the behavior of the OCR
engine, Tesseract.

When OCR is skipped
-------------------

If a page in a PDF seems to have text, by default OCRmyPDF will exit
without modifying the PDF. This is to ensure that PDFs that were
previously OCRed or were "born digital" rather than scanned are not
processed.

If ``--skip-text`` is issued, then no OCR will be performed on pages
that already have text. The page will be copied to the output. This may
be useful for documents that contain both "born digital" and scanned
content, or to use OCRmyPDF to normalize and convert to PDF/A regardless
of their contents.

If ``--redo-ocr`` is issued, then a detailed text analysis is performed.
Text is categorized as either visible or invisible. Invisible text (OCR)
is stripped out. Then an image of each page is created with visible text
masked out. The page image is sent for OCR, and any additional text is
inserted as OCR. If a file contains a mix of text and bitmap images that
contain text, OCRmyPDF will locate the additional text in images without
disrupting the existing text.

If ``--force-ocr`` is issued, then all pages will be rasterized to
images, discarding any hidden OCR text, and rasterizing any printable
text. This is useful for redoing OCR, for fixing OCR text with a damaged
character map (text is selectable but not searchable), and destroying
redacted information. Any forms and vector graphics will be rasterized
as well.

Time and image size limits
--------------------------

By default, OCRmyPDF permits tesseract to run for three minutes (180
seconds) per page. This is usually more than enough time to find all
text on a reasonably sized page with modern hardware.

If a page is skipped, it will be inserted without OCR. If preprocessing
was requested, the preprocessed image layer will be inserted.

If you want to adjust the amount of time spent on OCR, change
``--tesseract-timeout``. You can also automatically skip images that
exceed a certain number of megapixels with ``--skip-big``. (A 300 DPI,
8.5Ã—11" page is 8.4 megapixels.)

.. code-block:: bash

    # Allow 300 seconds for OCR; skip any page larger than 50 megapixels
    ocrmypdf --tesseract-timeout 300 --skip-big 50 bigfile.pdf output.pdf

Overriding default tesseract
----------------------------

OCRmyPDF checks the system ``PATH`` for the ``tesseract`` binary.

Some relevant environment variables that influence Tesseract's behavior
include:

.. envvar:: TESSDATA_PREFIX

   Overrides the path to Tesseract's data files. This can allow
   simultaneous installation of the "best" and "fast" training data
   sets. OCRmyPDF does not manage this environment variable.

.. envvar:: OMP_THREAD_LIMIT

   Controls the number of threads Tesseract will use. OCRmyPDF will
   manage this environment variable if it is not already set.

For example, if you have a development build of Tesseract don't wish to
use the system installation, you can launch OCRmyPDF as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    env \
        PATH=/home/user/src/tesseract/api:$PATH \
        TESSDATA_PREFIX=/home/user/src/tesseract \
        ocrmypdf input.pdf output.pdf

In this example ``TESSDATA_PREFIX`` is required to redirect Tesseract to
an alternate folder for its "tessdata" files.

Overriding other support programs
---------------------------------

In addition to tesseract, OCRmyPDF uses the following external binaries:

-  ``gs`` (Ghostscript)
-  ``unpaper``
-  ``pngquant``
-  ``jbig2``

In each case OCRmyPDF will search the ``PATH`` environment variable to
locate the binaries.

Changing tesseract configuration variables
------------------------------------------

You can override tesseract's default `control
parameters <https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/ControlParams>`__
with a configuration file.

As an example, this configuration will disable Tesseract's dictionary
for current language. Normally the dictionary is helpful for
interpolating words that are unclear, but it may interfere with OCR if
the document does not contain many words (for example, a list of part
numbers).

Create a file named "no-dict.cfg" with these contents:

::

    load_system_dawg 0
    language_model_penalty_non_dict_word 0
    language_model_penalty_non_freq_dict_word 0

then run ocrmypdf as follows (along with any other desired arguments):

.. code-block:: bash

    ocrmypdf --tesseract-config no-dict.cfg input.pdf output.pdf

.. warning::

   Some combinations of control parameters will break Tesseract or break
   assumptions that OCRmyPDF makes about Tesseract's output.

Changing the PDF renderer
=========================

rasterizing
  Converting a PDF to an image for display.

rendering
  Creating a new PDF from other data (such as an existing PDF).

OCRmyPDF has these PDF renderers: ``sandwich`` and ``hocr``. The
renderer may be selected using ``--pdf-renderer``. The default is
``auto`` which lets OCRmyPDF select the renderer to use. Currently,
``auto`` always selects ``sandwich``.

The ``sandwich`` renderer
-------------------------

The ``sandwich`` renderer uses Tesseract's new text-only PDF feature,
which produces a PDF page that lays out the OCR in invisible text. This
page is then "sandwiched" onto the original PDF page, allowing lossless
application of OCR even to PDF pages that contain other vector objects.

Currently this is the best renderer for most uses, however it is
implemented in Tesseract so OCRmyPDF cannot influence it. Currently some
problematic PDF viewers like Mozilla PDF.js and macOS Preview have
problems with segmenting its text output, and
mightrunseveralwordstogether.

When image preprocessing features like ``--deskew`` are used, the
original PDF will be rendered as a full page and the OCR layer will be
placed on top.

The ``hocr`` renderer
---------------------

The ``hocr`` renderer works with older versions of Tesseract. The image
layer is copied from the original PDF page if possible, avoiding
potentially lossy transcoding or loss of other PDF information. If
preprocessing is specified, then the image layer is a new PDF.

Unlike ``sandwich`` this renderer is implemented within OCRmyPDF; anyone
looking to customize how OCR is presented should look here. A major
disadvantage of this renderer is it not capable of correctly handling
text outside the Latin alphabet (specifically, it supports the ISO 8859-1
character). Pull requests to improve the situation are welcome.

Currently, this renderer has the best compatibility with Mozilla's
PDF.js viewer.

This works in all versions of Tesseract.

The ``tesseract`` renderer
--------------------------

The ``tesseract`` renderer was removed. OCRmyPDF's new approach to text
layer grafting makes it functionally equivalent to ``sandwich``.

Return code policy
==================

OCRmyPDF writes all messages to ``stderr``. ``stdout`` is reserved for
piping output files. ``stdin`` is reserved for piping input files.

The return codes generated by the OCRmyPDF are considered part of the
stable user interface. They may be imported from
``ocrmypdf.exceptions``.

.. list-table:: Return codes
    :widths: 5 35 60
    :header-rows: 1

    *	- Code

Debugging the intermediate files
================================

OCRmyPDF normally saves its intermediate results to a temporary folder
and deletes this folder when it exits, whether it succeeded or failed.

If the ``-k`` argument is issued on the command line, OCRmyPDF will keep
the temporary folder and print the location, whether it succeeded or
failed (provided the Python interpreter did not crash). An example
message is:

.. code-block:: none

    Temporary working files retained at:
    /tmp/ocrmypdf.io.u20wpz07

The organization of this folder is an implementation detail and subject
to change between releases. However the general organization is that
working files on a per page basis have the page number as a prefix
(starting with page 1), an infix indicates the processing stage, and a
suffix indicates the file type. Some important files include:

-  ``_rasterize.png`` - what the input page looks like
-  ``_ocr.png`` - the file that is sent to Tesseract for OCR; depending
   on arguments this may differ from the presentation image
-  ``_pp_deskew.png`` - the image, after deskewing
-  ``_pp_clean.png`` - the image, after cleaning with unpaper
-  ``_ocr_tess.pdf`` - the OCR file; appears as a blank page with invisible
   text embedded
-  ``_ocr_tess.txt`` - the OCR text (not necessarily all text on the page,
   if the page is mixed format)
-  ``fix_docinfo.pdf`` - a temporary file created to fix the PDF DocumentInfo
   data structure
-  ``graft_layers.pdf`` - the rendered PDF with OCR layers grafted on
-  ``pdfa.pdf`` - ``graft_layers.pdf`` after conversion to PDF/A
-  ``pdfa.ps`` - a PostScript file used by Ghostscript for PDF/A conversion
-  ``optimize.pdf`` - the PDF generated before optimization
-  ``optimize.out.pdf`` - the PDF generated by optimization
-  ``origin`` - the input file
-  ``origin.pdf`` - the input file or the input image converted to PDF
-  ``images/*`` - images extracted during the optimization process; here
   the prefix indicates a PDF object ID not a page number
