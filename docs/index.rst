OCRmyPDF documentation
======================

OCRmyPDF adds an optical character recognition (OCR) text layer to scanned PDF
files, allowing them to be searched.

PDF is the best format for storing and exchanging scanned documents.
Unfortunately, PDFs can be difficult to modify. OCRmyPDF makes it easy to apply
image processing and OCR to existing PDFs.
