OCRmyPDF documentation
======================

OCRmyPDF adds an OCR text layer to scanned PDF files, allowing them to
be searched.

PDF is the best format for storing and exchanging scanned documents.  Unfortunately, PDFs can be difficult to modify. OCRmyPDF makes it easy to apply image processing and OCR to existing PDFs.
