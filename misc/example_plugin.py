An example of an OCRmyPDF plugin.

This plugin adds two new command line arguments
    --grayscale-ocr: converts the image to grayscale before performing OCR on it
        (This is occasionally useful for images whose color confounds OCR. It only
        affects the image shown to OCR. The image is not saved.)
    --mono-page: converts pages all pages in the output file to black and white

To use this from the command line:
    ocrmypdf --plugin path/to/example_plugin.py --mono-page input.pdf output.pdf

To use this as an API:
    import ocrmypdf
    ocrmypdf.ocr('input.pdf', 'output.pdf',
        plugins=['path/to/example_plugin.py'], mono_page=True
    )
