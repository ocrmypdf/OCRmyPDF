DEPARTMENT OF STATE,
Washington, January 26, 1870,

The Secretary of State has the honor to submit herewith, for revision
by Congress, in conformity with the provisions of section 6 of the act
approved 22d of June, 1860, a copy of “regulations for the consular
courts of the United States in Japan,” decreed and issued by C. BE.

contain suggestions on the subject thereof.

and give efficiency to the courts created by the act.”

Respectfully submitted.
