 

THEY TIP-TOED ALONG.

Se We went tip-toeing along a path amongst

the trees back towards the end of the
widow’s garden, stooping down so as
the branches wouldn’t scrape our heads.
When we was passing by the kitchen
I fell over a root and made a noise.
We scrouched down and laid still.
Miss Watson’s big nigger, named
Jim, was setting in the kitchen door ;
we could see him pretty clear, because
there was a light behind him. He
got up and stretched his neck out
about a minute, listening. Then he
says,

“Who dah?”

He listened some more; then he
come tip-toeing down and_ stood
right between us; we could a touched
him, nearly. Well, likely it was min-
utes and minutes that there warn’t a
sound, and we all there so close
together. There was a place on my
ankle that got to itching; but I

dasn’t scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back, right be-
tween my shoulders. Seemed like I’d die if I couldn’t scratch. Well, I’ve

noticed that thing plenty of times since.
