with a plain face, on the throne of England;
there were a king with a large jaw and a queen
with a fair face, on the throne of France. In both
countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords
of the State preserves of loaves and fishes, that
things in general were settled for ever.

It was the year of Our Lord one thousand
seven hundred and seventy-five. Spiritual reve-
lations were conceded to England at that
favoured period, as at this. Mrs. Southcott had
recently attained her five-and-twentieth blessed
birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life
Guards had heralded the sublime appearance by
announcing that arrangements were made for the
swallowing up of London and Westminster.
Even the Cock-lane ghost had been laid only a
round dozen of years, after rapping out its mes-
sages, as the spirits of this very year last past
(supernaturally deficient in originality) rapped
out theirs. Mere messages in the earthly order of
events had lately come to the English Crown and
People, from a congress of British subjects in
America: which, strange to relate, have proved
more important to the human race than any com-
munications yet received through any of the
chickens of the Cock-lane brood.

France, less favoured on the whole as to mat-
ters spiritual than her sister of the shield and tri-
dent, rolled with exceeding smoothness down
hill, making paper money and spending it. Under
the guidance of her Christian pastors, she enter-
tained herself, besides, with such humane
achievements as sentencing a youth to have his

hands cut off, his tongue torn out with pincers,
and his body burned alive, because he had not
kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty
procession of monks which passed within his
view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty yards. It
is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of
France and Norway, there were growing trees,
when that sufferer was put to death, already
marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down
and be sawn into boards, to make a certain mov-
able framework with a sack and a knife in it, ter-
rible in history. It is likely enough that in the
rough outhouses of some tillers of the heavy
lands adjacent to Paris, there were sheltered
from the weather that very day, rude carts,
bespattered with rustic mire, snuffed about by
pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which the
Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his
tumbrils of the Revolution. But that Woodman
and that Farmer, though they work unceasingly,
work silently, and no one heard them as they
went about with muffled tread: the rather, foras-
much as to entertain any suspicion that they
were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous.

In England, there was scarcely an amount of
order and protection to justify much national
boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and
highway robberies, took place in the capital
itself every night; families were publicly cau-
tioned not to go out of town without removing
their furniture to upholsterers' warehouses for
security; the highwayman in the dark was a City
tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and
