    the image that will be shown to OCR.

    If the function does not want to modify the image, it should return
    ``image_filename``. The hook may overwrite ``image_filename`` with a new file.

    The output image should preserve the same physical unit dimensions, that is
    (width * dpi_x, height * dpi_y). That is, if the image is resized, the DPI
    must be adjusted by the reciprocal. If this is not preserved, the PDF page
    will be resized and the OCR layer misaligned. OCRmyPDF does not nothing
    to enforce these constraints; it is up to the plugin to do sensible things.

    OCRmyPDF will create the PDF page based on the image format used (unless the
    hook is overriden). If you convert the image to a JPEG, the output page will
    be created as a JPEG, etc. If you change the colorspace, that change will be
    kept. Note that the OCRmyPDF image optimization stage, if enabled, may
    ultimately chose a different format.

    If the return value is a file that does not exist, ``FileNotFoundError``
