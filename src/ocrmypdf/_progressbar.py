class ProgressBar(Protocol):
    """The protocol that OCRmyPDF expects progress bar classes to be compatible with.

    In practice this could be used for any time of monitoring, not just a progress bar.

    Calling the class should return a new progress bar object, which is activated
    with ``__enter__`` and terminated with ``__exit__``. An update method is called
    whenever the progress bar is updated. Progress bar objects will not be reused;
    a new one will be created for each group of tasks.

    The progress bar is held in the main process/thread and not updated by child
    process/threads. When a child notifies the parent of completed work, the
    parent updates the progress bar.
    Progress bars should never write to ``sys.stdout``, or they will corrupt the
    output if OCRmyPDF writes a PDF to standard output.

    Note:
        The type of events that OCRmyPDF reports to a progress bar may change in
    minor releases.

    Args:
        total (int | float | None):
            The total number of work units expected. If ``None``, the total is unknown.
            For example, if you are processing pages, this might be the number of pages,
            or if you are measuring overall progress in percent, this might be 100.
        desc (str | None):
            A brief description of the current step (e.g. "Scanning contents",
            "OCR", "PDF/A conversion"). OCRmyPDF updates this before each major step.
        unit (str | None):
            A short label for the type of work being tracked
            (e.g. "page", "%", "image").
        disable (bool):
            If ``True``, progress updates are suppressed (no output).
             Defaults to ``False``.
        **kwargs:
            Future or extra parameters that OCRmyPDF might pass. Implementations
            should accept and ignore unrecognized keywords gracefully.

    Example:
        A simple plugin implementation could look like this:

        .. code-block:: python

            from ocrmypdf.pluginspec import ProgressBar

        OCRmyPDF calls this method repeatedly while processing pages or other tasks.

        .. code-block:: python

            self.current += n
            percent = (self.current / total) * 100

        The ``completed`` argument can indicate an absolute position, which is
        particularly helpful if you're tracking a percentage of work (e.g., 0 to 100)
        and want precise updates. In contrast, the incremental parameter ``n`` is
        often more useful for page-based increments.

        Args:
            n (float, optional):
                The amount to increment the progress by. Defaults to 1. May be
                fractional if OCRmyPDF performs partial steps. If you are tracking
                pages, this is typically how many pages have been processed in the
                most recent step.
            completed (float | None, optional):
                The absolute amount of work completed so far. This can override or
                supplement the simple increment logic. It's particularly useful
                for percentage-based tracking (e.g., when ``total`` is 100).
