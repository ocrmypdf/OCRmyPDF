                     GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                        Version 3, 19 November 2007
 .
  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 .
                             Preamble
 .
   The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
 software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
 cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.
 .
   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
 to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
 our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
 share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
 software for all its users.
 .
   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
 want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
 free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
 .
   Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
 with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
 you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
 and/or modify the software.
 .
   A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
 improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
 receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
 incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
 encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
 software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
 The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
 letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
 source code to the public.
 .
   The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
 ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
 to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
 provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
 users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
 a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
 code of the modified version.
 .
   An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
 published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
 a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
 released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
 this license.
 .
   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow.
 .
                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 .
   0. Definitions.
 .
   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.
 .
   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
 works, such as semiconductor masks.
 .
   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
 License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
 "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
 .
   To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
 in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
 exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
 earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
 .
   A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
 on the Program.
 .
   To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
 permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
 infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
 computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
 distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
 public, and in some countries other activities as well.
 .
   To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
 parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
 a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
 .
   An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
 to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
 feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
 tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
 extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
 work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
 the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
 menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
 .
   1. Source Code.
 .
   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
 for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
 form of a work.
 .
   A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
 standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
 interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
 is widely used among developers working in that language.
 .
   The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
 than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
 packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
 Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
 Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
 implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
 "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
 (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
 (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
 produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
 .
   The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
 the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
 work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
 control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
 System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
 programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
 which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
 includes interface definition files associated with source files for
 the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
 linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
 such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
 subprograms and other parts of the work.
 .
   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
 can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
 Source.
 .
   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
 same work.
 .
   2. Basic Permissions.
 .
   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
 copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
 conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
 permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
 covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
 content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
 rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
 .
   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
 convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
 in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
 of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
 with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
 the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
 not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
 for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
 and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
 your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
 .
   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
 the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
 makes it unnecessary.
 .
   3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
 .
   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
 measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
 similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
 measures.
 .
   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
 circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
 is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
 the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
 modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
 users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
 technological measures.
 .
   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
 .
   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
 receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
 appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
 keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
 non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
 keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
 recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
 .
   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
 and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
 .
   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
 .
   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
 produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
 terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
 .
     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
     it, and giving a relevant date.
 .
     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
     released under this License and any conditions added under section
     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
     "keep intact all notices".
 .
     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
 .
     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
     work need not make them do so.
 .
   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
 works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
 and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
 in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
 "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
 used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
 beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
 in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
 parts of the aggregate.
 .
   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
 .
   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
 of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
 machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
 in one of these ways:
 .
     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
     customarily used for software interchange.
 .
     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
     written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
     long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
     model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
     copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
     medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
     conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
 .
     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
     with subsection 6b.
 .
     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
     place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
     Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
     further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
     Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
     may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
     available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
 .
     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
     Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
     charge under subsection 6d.
 .
   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
 from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
 included in conveying the object code work.
 .
   A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
 tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
 or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
 into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
 doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
 product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
 typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
 of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
 actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
 is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
 commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
 the only significant mode of use of the product.
 .
   "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
 procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
 and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
 a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
 suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
 code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
 modification has been made.
 .
   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
 specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
 part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
 User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
 fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
 Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
 by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
 if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
 modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
 been installed in ROM).
 .
   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
 requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
 for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
 the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
 network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
 adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
 protocols for communication across the network.
 .
   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
 in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
 documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
 source code form), and must require no special password or key for
 unpacking, reading or copying.
 .
   7. Additional Terms.
 .
   "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
 License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
 Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
 be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
 that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
 apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
 under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
 this License without regard to the additional permissions.
 .
   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
 remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
 it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
 removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
 additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
 for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
 .
   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
 add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
 that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
 .
     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
 .
     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
     Notices displayed by works containing it; or
 .
     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
 .
     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
     authors of the material; or
 .
     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
 .
     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
     those licensors and authors.
 .
   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
 restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
 received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
 governed by this License along with a term that is a further
 restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
 a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
 License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
 of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
 not survive such relicensing or conveying.
 .
   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
 must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
 additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
 where to find the applicable terms.
 .
   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
 form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
 the above requirements apply either way.
 .
   8. Termination.
 .
   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
 provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
 modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
 this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
 paragraph of section 11).
 .
   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
 license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
 provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
 finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
 holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
 prior to 60 days after the cessation.
 .
   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
 reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
 violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
 received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
 copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
 your receipt of the notice.
 .
   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
 licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
 this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
 reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
 material under section 10.
 .
   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
 .
   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
 run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
 occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
 to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
 nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
 modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
 not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
 covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
 .
   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
 .
   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
 receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
 propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
 for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
 .
   An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
 organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
 organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
 work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
 transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
 licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
 give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
 Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
 the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
 .
   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
 rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
 not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
 rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
 (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
 any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
 sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
 .
   11. Patents.
 .
   A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
 License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
 work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
 .
   A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
 owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
 hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
 by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
 but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
 consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
 purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
 patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
 this License.
 .
   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
 patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
 make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
 propagate the contents of its contributor version.
 .
   In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
 agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
 (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
 sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
 party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
 patent against the party.
 .
   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
 and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
 to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
 publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
 then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
 available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
 patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
 consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
 license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
 actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
 covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
 in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
 country that you have reason to believe are valid.
 .
   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
 arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
 covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
 receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
 or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
 you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
 work and works based on it.
 .
   A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
 the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
 conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
 specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
 work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
 in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
 to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
 the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
 parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
 patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
 conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
 for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
 contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
 or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
 .
   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
 any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
 otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
 .
   12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
 .
   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
 excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
 covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
 not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
 to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
 the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
 License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
 .
   13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.
 .
   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
 Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
 interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version
 supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
 Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source
 from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary
 means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source
 shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3
 of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the
 following paragraph.
 .
   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
 permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
 under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
 combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
 License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
 but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version
 3 of the GNU General Public License.
 .
   14. Revised Versions of this License.
 .
   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
 the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
 will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
 address new problems or concerns.
 .
   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
 Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General
 Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
 option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
 version or of any later version published by the Free Software
 Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
 GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
 by the Free Software Foundation.
 .
   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
 versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's
 public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
 to choose that version for the Program.
 .
   Later license versions may give you additional or different
 permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
 author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
 later version.
 .
   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
 .
   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
 APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
 HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
 OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
 THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
 IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
 ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 .
   16. Limitation of Liability.
 .
   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
 WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
 THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
 GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
 USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
 DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
 PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
 EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
 SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
 .
   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
 above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
 reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
 an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
 Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
 copy of the Program in return for a fee.
 .
                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 .
             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
 .
   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
 possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
 free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
 .
   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
 to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
 state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
 the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
 .
     <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
 .
     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
     (at your option) any later version.
 .
     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
     GNU Affero General Public License for more details.
 .
     You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
     along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
 .
 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
 .
   If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer
 network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to
 get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its
 interface could display a "Source" link that leads users to an archive
 of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different
 solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the
 specific requirements.
 .
   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
 if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
 For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see

License: CC-BY-SA-1.0
 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
 CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS
 PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE
 WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE IS PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND
 AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS
 YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF
 SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions
 .
     "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue,
     anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in
     unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions,
     constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are
     assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
     Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as
     defined below) for the purposes of this License.  "Derivative
     Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other
     pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement,
     dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound
     recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any
     other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or
     adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work
     will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this
     License.  "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers
     the Work under the terms of this License.  "Original Author" means
     the individual or entity who created the Work.  "Work" means the
     copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this
     License.  "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights
     under this License who has not previously violated the terms of
     this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express
     permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License
     despite a previous violation.
 .
 2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce,
 limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or
 other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under
 copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
 exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
     to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
     Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
     Collective Works; to create and reproduce Derivative Works; to
     distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
     publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
     transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective
     Works; to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly,
     perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
     transmission Derivative Works;
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
 known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
 such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
 in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by
 Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
 made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
     You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
     publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this
     License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
     Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the
     Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
     publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
     on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or
     the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may
     not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that
     refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may
     not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
     digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that
     control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with
     the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work
     as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require
     the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject
     to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work,
     upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
     remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or
     the Original Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative
     Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
     practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such
     Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.  You may
     distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
     digitally perform a Derivative Work only under the terms of this
     License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
     Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of
     each Derivative Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly
     perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or
     impose any terms on the Derivative Works that alter or restrict
     the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the
     rights granted hereunder, and You must keep intact all notices
     that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
     warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly
     perform, or publicly digitally perform the Derivative Work with
     any technological measures that control access or use of the Work
     in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License
     Agreement. The above applies to the Derivative Work as
     incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the
     Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself to be made
     subject to the terms of this License.  If you distribute, publicly
     display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work
     or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact
     all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author
     credit reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by
     conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original
     Author if supplied; the title of the Work if supplied; in the case
     of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in
     the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
     Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by
     Original Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any
     reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a
     Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will
     appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in
     a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship
     credit.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
     By offering the Work for public release under this License,
         Licensor represents and warrants that, to the best of
         Licensor's knowledge after reasonable inquiry: Licensor has
         secured all rights in the Work necessary to grant the license
         rights hereunder and to permit the lawful exercise of the
         rights granted hereunder without You having any obligation to
         pay any royalties, compulsory license fees, residuals or any
         other payments; The Work does not infringe the copyright,
         trademark, publicity rights, common law rights or any other
         right of any third party or constitute defamation, invasion of
         privacy or other tortious injury to any third party.  EXCEPT
         AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS LICENSE OR OTHERWISE AGREED IN
         WRITING OR REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE WORK IS LICENSED ON
         AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER
         EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
         WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTENTS OR ACCURACY OF THE WORK.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY
 APPLICABLE LAW, AND EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM LIABILITY TO A
 THIRD PARTY RESULTING FROM BREACH OF THE WARRANTIES IN SECTION 5, IN
 NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY
 SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
 ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR
 HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
     This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
     automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this
     License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative
     Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however,
     will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals
     or entities remain in full compliance with those
     licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any
     termination of this License.  Subject to the above terms and
     conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the
     duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
     the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under
     different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any
     time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
     withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
     required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
     License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated
     as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
     Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or
     a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license
     to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license
     granted to You under this License.  Each time You distribute or
     publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to
     the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and
     conditions as the license granted to You under this License.  If
     any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
     applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
     of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further
     action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
     reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision
     valid and enforceable.  No term or provision of this License shall
     be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or
     consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged
     with such waiver or consent.  This License constitutes the entire
     agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed
     here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations
     with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be
     bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any
     communication from You. This License may not be modified without
     the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

License: CC-BY-SA-2.0
 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
 CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS
 PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE
 WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS
 PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND
 AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS
 YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF
 SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions
 .
     "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue,
     anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in
     unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions,
     constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are
     assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
     Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as
     defined below) for the purposes of this License.  "Derivative
     Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other
     pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement,
     dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound
     recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any
     other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or
     adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work
     will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this
     License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
     composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in
     timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered
     a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.  "Licensor"
     means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the
     terms of this License.  "Original Author" means the individual or
     entity who created the Work.  "Work" means the copyrightable work
     of authorship offered under the terms of this License.  "You"
     means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License
     who has not previously violated the terms of this License with
     respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from
     the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a
     previous violation.  "License Elements" means the following
     high-level license attributes as selected by Licensor and
     indicated in the title of this License: Attribution, ShareAlike.
 .
 2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce,
 limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or
 other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under
 copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
 exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
     to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
     Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
     Collective Works; to create and reproduce Derivative Works; to
     distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
     publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
     transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective
     Works; to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly,
     perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
     transmission Derivative Works.
 .
     For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical
         composition: Performance Royalties Under Blanket
         Licenses. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect,
         whether individually or via a performance rights society
         (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance
         or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.
         Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the
         exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
         music rights society or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox
         Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the
         Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the
         compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US
         Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
         Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance
         of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives
         the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
         performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for
         the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work,
         subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section
         114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other
         jurisdictions).
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
 known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
 such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
 in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by
 Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
 made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
     You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
     publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this
     License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
     Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the
     Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
     publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
     on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or
     the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may
     not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that
     refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may
     not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
     digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that
     control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with
     the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work
     as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require
     the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject
     to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work,
     upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
     remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or
     the Original Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative
     Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
     practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such
     Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.  You may
     distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
     digitally perform a Derivative Work only under the terms of this
     License, a later version of this License with the same License
     Elements as this License, or a Creative Commons iCommons license
     that contains the same License Elements as this License
     (e.g. Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Japan). You must include a copy
     of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License or other
     license specified in the previous sentence with every copy or
     phonorecord of each Derivative Work You distribute, publicly
     display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may
     not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative Works that alter
     or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise
     of the rights granted hereunder, and You must keep intact all
     notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
     warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly
     perform, or publicly digitally perform the Derivative Work with
     any technological measures that control access or use of the Work
     in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License
     Agreement. The above applies to the Derivative Work as
     incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the
     Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself to be made
     subject to the terms of this License.  If you distribute, publicly
     display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work
     or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact
     all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author
     credit reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by
     conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original
     Author if supplied; the title of the Work if supplied; to the
     extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if
     any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,
     unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or
     licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a
     Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the
     Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original
     Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original
     Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
     provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or
     Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any
     other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at
     least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

     duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
     the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under

     time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
     withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
     required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
     License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated
     as stated above.

     the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and
     conditions as the license granted to You under this License.  If
     any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
     applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
     of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further
     action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
     reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision
     valid and enforceable.  No term or provision of this License shall
     be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or
     consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged
     with such waiver or consent.  This License constitutes the entire
     agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed
     here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations

License: CC-BY-SA-2.5
 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
 CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS
 PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE
 WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS
 PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND
 AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS
 YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF
 SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions
 .
     "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue,
     anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in
     unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions,
     constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are
     assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
     Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as
     defined below) for the purposes of this License.  "Derivative
     Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other
     pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement,
     dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound
     recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any
     other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or
     adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work
     will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this
     License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
     composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in
     timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered
     a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.  "Licensor"
     means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the
     terms of this License.  "Original Author" means the individual or
     entity who created the Work.  "Work" means the copyrightable work
     of authorship offered under the terms of this License.  "You"
     means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License
     who has not previously violated the terms of this License with
     respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from
     the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a
     previous violation.  "License Elements" means the following
     high-level license attributes as selected by Licensor and
     indicated in the title of this License: Attribution, ShareAlike.
 .
 2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce,
 limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or
 other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under
 copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
 exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
     to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
     Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
     Collective Works; to create and reproduce Derivative Works; to
     distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
     publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
     transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective
     Works; to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly,
     perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
     transmission Derivative Works.
 .
     For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical
         composition: Performance Royalties Under Blanket
         Licenses. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect,
         whether individually or via a performance rights society
         (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance
         or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.
         Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the
         exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
         music rights society or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox
         Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the
         Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the
         compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US
         Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
         Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance
         of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives
         the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
         performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for
         the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work,
         subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section
         114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other
         jurisdictions).
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
 known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
 such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
 in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by
 Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
 made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
     You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
     publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this
     License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
     Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the
     Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
     publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
     on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or
     the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may
     not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that
     refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may
     not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
     digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that
     control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with
     the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work
     as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require
     the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject
     to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work,
     upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
     remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by clause
     4(c), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice
     from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from
     the Derivative Work any credit as required by clause 4(c), as
     requested.  You may distribute, publicly display, publicly
     perform, or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work only
     under the terms of this License, a later version of this License
     with the same License Elements as this License, or a Creative
     Commons iCommons license that contains the same License Elements
     as this License (e.g. Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5 Japan). You must
     include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this
     License or other license specified in the previous sentence with
     every copy or phonorecord of each Derivative Work You distribute,
     publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
     perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative
     Works that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the
     recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder, and You must
     keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
     disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly
     display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the
     Derivative Work with any technological measures that control
     access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms
     of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Derivative
     Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not
     require the Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself
     to be made subject to the terms of this License.  If you
     distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
     digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective
     Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
     provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i)
     the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if
     supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor
     designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute,
     publishing entity, journal) for attribution in Licensor's
     copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means,
     the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if
     supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform
     Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be
     associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
     copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the
     case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the
     Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work
     by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by
     Original Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any
     reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a
     Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will
     appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in
     a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship
     credit.

 measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the
 Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
 the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as
 incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection

 mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"), you must
 comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the
 following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for,
 the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You

 License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to the
 Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy
 of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly
 Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation,

 from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the
 terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the
 Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require
 the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to
 the terms of the Applicable License.
 .
 c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations
 or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to
 Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
 provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the
 name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,
 and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party
 or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
 attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice,
 terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party
 or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the
 extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
 specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
 refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;
 and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an
 Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation
 (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or
 "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit
 required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable
 manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or
 Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all
 contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as
 part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the
 credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of
 doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the
 purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising
 Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly
 assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the
 Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate,
 of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior
 written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
 Parties.
 .
 d. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
 otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
 Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
 Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or
 take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be
 prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor
 agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise
 of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to
 make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,
 modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original
 Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert,
 as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the
 applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your
 right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)
 but not otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,
 LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
 WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
 STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
 TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
 NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
 OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
 DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
 WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY
 APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY
 LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
 EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,
 EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
 a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
 automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this
 License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or
 Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their
 licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in
 full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8
 will survive any termination of this License.
 .
 b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here
 is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the
 Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to
 release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing
 the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will
 not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has
 been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License),
 and this License will continue in full force and effect unless
 terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
 a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
 Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work
 on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
 this License.
 .
 b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation,
 Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the
 same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this
 License.
 .
 c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
 applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
 the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action
 by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to
 the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
 enforceable.
 .
 d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
 breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
 and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
 .
 e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
 with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
 agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
 here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
 may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
 modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
 .
 f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in
 this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne
 Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as
 amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO
 Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty
 of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24,
 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant
 jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced
 according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of
 those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the
 standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law
 includes additional rights not granted under this License, such
 additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this
 License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under
 applicable law.

 By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be
 bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
 Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To
 the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
 granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms
 and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of
 benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available
 under these terms and conditions.
 .
 Section 1 – Definitions.
 .
  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights
     that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the
     Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or
     otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and
     Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License,
     where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound
     recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material
     is synched in timed relation with a moving image.
  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar
     Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the
     terms and conditions of this Public License.
  c. BY-SA Compatible License means a license listed at creativecommons.org/
     compatiblelicenses, approved by Creative Commons as essentially the
     equivalent of this Public License.
  d. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely
     related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast,
     sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the
     rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the
     rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
     Rights.
  e. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence
     of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling
     obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on
     December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.
  f. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other
     exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to
     Your use of the Licensed Material.
  g. License Elements means the license attributes listed in the name of a
     Creative Commons Public License. The License Elements of this Public
     License are Attribution and ShareAlike.
  h. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other
     material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.
  i. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and
     conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and
     Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the
     Licensor has authority to license.
  j. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this
     Public License.
  k. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that
     requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public
     display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or
     importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways
     that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a
     time individually chosen by them.
  l. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting
     from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11
     March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or
     succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the
     world.
  m. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under
     this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
 .
 Section 2 – Scope.
 .
  a. License grant.
      1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the
         Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
         non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the
         Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
          A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and
          B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
      2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
         Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does
         not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.
      3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).
      4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor
         authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats
         whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical
         modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not
         to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical
         modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
         technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological
         Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making
         modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted
         Material.
      5. Downstream recipients.
          A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the
             Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor
             to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of
             this Public License.
          B. Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material. Every
             recipient of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an
             offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the
             Adapted Material under the conditions of the Adapter’s License You
             apply.
          C. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any
             additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any
             Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing
             so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of
             the Licensed Material.
      6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be
         construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your
         use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored,
         endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others
         designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
  b. Other rights.
 .
      1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under
         this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar
         personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor
         waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor
         to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
         Rights, but not otherwise.
      2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
      3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect
         royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether
         directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or
         waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases
         the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.
 .
 Section 3 – License Conditions.
 .
 Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following
 conditions.
 .
  a. Attribution.
 .
      1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You
         must:
 .
          A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the
             Licensed Material:
              i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and
                 any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable
                 manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                 designated);
             ii. a copyright notice;
             iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
             iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;
              v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent
                 reasonably practicable;
          B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an
             indication of any previous modifications; and
          C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public
             License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this
             Public License.
      2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable
         manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the
         Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the
         conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes
         the required information.
      3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information
         required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.
  b. ShareAlike.
 .
     In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted
     Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.
 .
      1. The Adapter’s License You apply must be a Creative Commons license with
         the same License Elements, this version or later, or a BY-SA Compatible
         License.
      2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter's
         License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable
         manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share
         Adapted Material.
      3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or
         conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to,
         Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the
         Adapter's License You apply.
 .
 Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.
 .
 Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to
 Your use of the Licensed Material:
 .
  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to
     extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the
     contents of the database;
  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a
     database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database
     in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual
     contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and
  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a
     substantial portion of the contents of the database.
 .
 For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace
 Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include
 other Copyright and Similar Rights.
 .
 Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
 .
  a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent
     possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available,
     and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the
     Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This
     includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
     for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other
     defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not
     known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in
     full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.
  b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on
     any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise
     for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive,
     exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this
     Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has
     been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or
     damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part,
     this limitation may not apply to You.
 .
  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above
     shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely
     approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.
 .
 Section 6 – Term and Termination.
 .
  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar
     Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public
     License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate
     automatically.
  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section
     6(a), it reinstates:
 .
      1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is
         cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
      2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the
     Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public
     License.
  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed
     Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the
     Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this
     Public License.
  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.
 .
 Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.
 .
  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or
     conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed
     Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms
     and conditions of this Public License.
 .
 Section 8 – Interpretation.
 .
  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be
     interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of
     the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under
     this Public License.
  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed
     unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent
     necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it
     shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the
     enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.
  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure
     to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.
  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a
     limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to
     the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction
     or authority.
